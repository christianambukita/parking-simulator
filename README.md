# Parking mini-game

This is just a small experiment project.

## Inspiration
My inspiration was my girlfriend who started driving recently and had a little trouble with parking my car. As we know parking can be challanging and to help her understand how parking "works" I decided to create this mini-game.

## Challenge
I tried my best to mimic real life car behavior during turning which is crutial in parking. To do this I had to make sure that cars center of roration is in point of intersection of rear wheels axis and front wheel axis.
